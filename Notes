notes:

MACRO vs WEIGHTED ACERAGES:
If you want to treat all classes equally, then using macro average would be a good choice. If you have an imbalanced dataset but want to assign more weight to classes with more samples, consider using weighted average

Chi-square:
A chi-square (χ2) statistic is a measure of the difference between the observed and expected frequencies of the outcomes of a set of events or variables.
Chi-square is useful for analyzing such differences in categorical variables, especially those nominal in nature.
χ2 depends on the size of the difference between actual and observed values, the degrees of freedom, and the sample size.
χ2 can be used to test whether two variables are related or independent of each other.
It can also be used to test the goodness of fit between an observed distribution and a theoretical distribution of frequencies.
